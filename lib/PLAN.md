What is the problem exactly?
Making a program that tells the user the shortest path to the entered cooridates, on a 8x8 graph.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like?
There will be no interface. It was a CMD program

What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
The inputs will be coordinates in array form. There will be two, the starting coordinate and the end coordinate. The user will enter nothing. The inpts come from the main.rb file that runs tests and outputs the results with along with a description to the console

What’s the desired output?
The shortest path to the desired coordinate or vertex on the graph

Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

Ideas:
Board rule and knight's possible movements
Although its an 8x8 graph, the vertices arent directly linked. Since the rules of the game are that the knight can only move in weird patterns, the vertices neighbours
wont be close to them.
Knights possible moves, in the form of 2d coordinates. Notice, the graph is an indirect graph, meaning [x, y] gets the same result as [y, x]
(x, y): [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, -1], [1, -2], [-1, -2], [-2, -1], [-2, 1], [-1, 2]

Generating the board
WRONG: Have the board generated by having two #times methods going. 8 times for the x coordinate, plugging into an array then 8 times for the y coordinate.

Use the knight's moves to generate the 8x8 board, or whatever sized board is specified. If the rules are followed, them being that the knight cant move outside of the 8x8 board, there should only be 64 vertices. My guess is that, obviously, the board will use a recusive method to generate the vertices. First, its checked if the knight's move is
within the game rules. If so, then check if the coordinate of that move from the current position exist. If it doesn't, generate that coordinate, else fill the move. I'm thinking that it's best to have a queue that each coordinate is added to if it was generated from another node. Also that coordinate has the 8 knight's moves as instance variables.

Instructions: 
Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.

Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Don’t allow any moves to go off the board.

Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.

Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square.
